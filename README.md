# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning algorithms I implemented from scratch using Python.

Algorithms implemented from scratch till date:

1. [Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](): implemented with Python.

2. [KNN Classifier](): implemented with Python.

3. [Linear Regression](): implemented with Python.

The machine learning algorithms' implementations were used to work on machine learning projects such as:

1. Iris flowers classification
