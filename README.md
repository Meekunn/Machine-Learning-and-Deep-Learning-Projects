# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and deep learning algorithms I implemented from scratch using Python.

Algorithms implemented from scratch till date:

1. [Artificial Neural Network (ANN)](https://github.com/Meekunn/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/ANN): implemented with Python.

2. [KNN Classifier](https://github.com/Meekunn/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/KNN_Classifier): implemented with Python.

3. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/Meekunn/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Linear_Regressor): implemented with Python.

The machine learning algorithms' implementations were used to work on machine learning projects such as:

1. Iris flowers classification
